# Music-player
This is a simple project made by html,css and javascript.
It contains a list of my favourite songs which you can listen. 
Also, it contains the basic functionality of a music player such as play, pause, previous and next buttons.
It also does contains a seekbar that allows you to toggle to any part of the song
